## Overview

Your thesis is an opportunity for you to create something that speaks to your viewpoint, your interests, and your work at ITP over the past two years. It's also an opportunity to move through the entire product development cycle, and to do that with the scaffolding of a community of other people going through the process with you. 

The process is divided into three parts:

- **Research & Concept Development** - Weeks 1 -3

- **Design/Prototype/Production** - Weeks 4 - 11
  - This should be split into producing your work and testing/iterating. 
- **Presentation** - Weeks 12-14 

You're expected to be documenting throughout the entire process. 

## Class Format 

Our class is expected to operate as a support for you, a place where you can work out your ideas and find productive critique. The class format will change throughout the semester to best reflect this. At the beginning and end of the semester, the entire class will meet together. Throughout the semester, the meetings will switch to being one-on-ones with me and the residents, or small group meetings.

In a way, the residents and I are your project managers/editors/feedback providers. We are here to check in on you, make sure that you're doing what you need to be doing, and help give you the scaffolding that you might need. However, everyone has different projects and working styles, so this may take different forms for each of you. 

Regardless of what our meeting structure looks like, the floor is dedicated to thesis from Tuesdays after 3pm. And remember: our class is here to support one another! Be there for your classmates as an engaged participant in their projects. We should all be rooting for one another. 

## Major Milestones

- **April 16**: Project Summaries and Materials due for Thesis Archive
- **May 7:** Final presentations with outside critics 
  - Project and Documentation in Thesis Journal must be approved by Thesis Advisors by this point 
- **May 13 - 17**: Thesis Week 

## Thesis Journal (TJ)

The thesis journal is the primary way that we have to see how you're doing and what your work is looking like. We'll often ask you to post in it. We're not looking for professional writing–these are more just notes to you, me, and the residents. These often end up being extremely useful for you as you continue through the semester. Some weeks there will be a specific assignment to post as your weekly update. 

## Additional Support

Aside from me, Ellen, and Alden, remember that you can seek out the advice and support of the ITP Fellows, Margaret Smith (the Physical Sciences Librarian at Bobst), other ITP/IMA faculty, and others. 

## A Final Note

Everything that's on this page can be found on the main thesis syllabus as well. This is more for people who prefer something customized to us and who like to have syllabi presented weekly rather than all at once. 

## Syllabus 

### Week 1: Jan 28

*Introductions to each other, syllabus overview, logistics of the semester, and portfolio presentations.*

**Assignment:** 

-  **Dream Review:** Write a rave review for your thesis/product.  Make it *Over-the-top positive*, and imagine it appears in whatever outlet where you would most like the publicity. Have fun with it, but take this seriously, as it helps the process of making your idea real and knowing how you want it to be received (and by whom).  Focus on the adjectives you use to describe the project, and make sure you post to the thesis journal. Remember, you should include: 
  	- What it is 
  	- What it does 
  	- Who would use it
  	- Why the maker made it
  	- The tone, experience, etc. 
  	- Post to the Thesis Journal/ 
- **Research Chart**: Make a (physical, analog) chart with the questions you have a answers so far and bring it to class. You will share it in class, and colleagues will make suggestions. Then post it on the TJ along with any other summary of your research to date. Here are some critical questions to answer (as relevant for your specific idea):
  -  What else is out there like it? 
  - How is yours different? 
  - How does it improve what exists? 
  - What audience is it for? 
  - What is the world/context/ market that your project lives in? 
  - In your initial research, have you found something you didn’t expect? Is it an interesting path to follow? 
  - What do you need to know about the content/story? 
  - What do you need from a tech standpoint? 
  - If it’s too much for the time...what are the discrete parts of it you could accomplish? 
- **Bibliography**: Start a bibliography/reference resource of all the references that you're consulting. Don't put this on the chart, but keep a digital collection using some tool that can help you keep track of everything (CSV, Google Docs, static web site, Are.na, Zotero, Evernote, Tumblr, Git whatever works for you.)
