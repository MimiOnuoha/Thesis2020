## Overview

Your thesis is an opportunity for you to create something that speaks to your viewpoint, your interests, and your work at ITP. It's also an opportunity to move through the entire product development cycle, and to do that with the scaffolding of a community of other people going through the process with you. 

The process is divided into three parts:

- **Research & Concept Development** - Weeks 1 -3

- **Design/Prototype/Production** - Weeks 4 - 11
  - This should be split into producing your work and testing/iterating. 
- **Presentation** - Weeks 12-14 

You're expected to be documenting throughout the entire process. 

## Class Format 

Our class is expected to operate as a support for you, a place where you can work out your ideas and find productive critique. The class format will change throughout the semester to best reflect this. At the beginning and end of the semester, the entire class will meet together. Throughout the semester, the meetings will switch to being one-on-ones with me and the residents, or small group meetings.

In a way, the residents and I are your project managers/editors/feedback providers. We are here to check in on you, make sure that you're doing what you need to be doing, and help give you the scaffolding that you might need. However, everyone has different projects and working styles, so this may take different forms for each of you. 

Regardless of what our meeting structure looks like, the floor is dedicated to thesis from Tuesdays after 3pm. And remember: our class is here to support one another! Be there for your classmates as an engaged participant in their projects. We should all be rooting for one another. 

## Major Milestones

- **February 14:** Thesis proposal due at 5:00pm. This is a form that everyone must submit, in order to proceed with thesis the proposal you describe must be approved by the other faculty members. 
- **March 10**: Thesis midterm presentations  (in class, with external guests)
- **March 12**: After this point, thesis topic cannot be changed
- **April 2:** Quick and Dirty Show with First Years, Alums, and next year's First Years 
- **April 16**: Project Summaries and Materials due for Thesis Archive
- **May 7:** Final presentations with outside critics 
  - Project and Documentation in Thesis Journal must be approved by Thesis Advisors by this point 
- **May 13 - 17**: Thesis Week 

## Thesis Journal (TJ)

The thesis journal is the primary way that we have to see how you're doing and what your work is looking like. We'll often ask you to post in it. We're not looking for professional writing–these are more just notes to you, me, and the residents. These often end up being extremely useful for you as you continue through the semester. Some weeks there will be a specific assignment to post as your weekly update. 

Note: Everything that's on this page can be found on the main thesis syllabus as well. This is more for people who prefer something customized to us and who like to have syllabi presented weekly rather than all at once. The thesis journal is the more official repository, though. 

## Syllabus 


  ### Week 3: Feb 11
  
  *Check in and share prototypes + make a production schedule with the residents* 
  
  **Assignment:** 
  
  - **Post your bibliography to the thesis blog.** If you have done this already, don't worry about it. In general, we want to be able to see the references and sources your project is in conversation with. 
  
  - **Turn in your thesis statement.** You should be able to access this on the top header  bar of your section frontage. Keep in mind that you will not be able to see your thesis statement if you haven't written at least one progress post. You have to post this by Friday, Feb 14 at 5:00pm—you won't have access after this time!  
  -  **Work on your project**. Do whatever you need to do. 
  
  Note: look out for an email from me about next week! We won't be meeting as a group, but we have the classroom booked, the floor is yours, and you can use the time to meet with me, the residents, or one another.

### Week 2: Feb 4 

*Residents talk about their theses, exercise on research*

**Assignment:** 

- **Model/Prototype/whatever it is**: Come to class next week with the result of the prompt that I emailed you about last week. This should take the form of a model, prototype, intervention, exercise, etc. If you didn't get a direct prompt from me, then come with some kind of model, sample, prototype: a quick intervention that is tangible, and that gets you into production mode. Post something in the thesis journal about this, either documentation or the link to the product. 

  - Our goal is for you to feel good about your idea and direction after this week so this is important to have!

- If you feel ready, **you may want to start fleshing out the questions for the thesis proposal**. Check the supporting documents folder to see hem. 

- [optional]**Daily Sketches:** This is to help you get into the habit of working/thinking about your thesis every day. Answer one of these questions each day and post on the thesis blog:

  - **Day 1**: A song that represents the mood or vibe of my thesis world
  - **Day 2**: What are the worst possible ways to address my thesis statement or question?
  - **Day 3**: What are three images that represent the world or mood of your thesis?
  - **Day 4**: What are three questions that I’ll investigate with my thesis project?
  - **Day 5**: What are three possible venues for this work to be shown (or to live)? Why do I want to be part of these institutions or venues?
  - **Day 6**: Three experts or types of people to speak to about my thesis (can be people who are accessible to you and who aren't)

### Week 1: Jan 28

*Introductions to each other, syllabus overview, logistics of the semester, and portfolio presentations.*

**Assignment:** 

-  **Dream Review:** Write a rave review for your thesis/product.  You don't have to spend more than 15-20 minutes on this, but make it *over-the-top positive*, and imagine it appears in whatever outlet where you would most like the publicity. Have fun with it, but take this seriously, as it helps the process of making your idea real and knowing how you want it to be received (and by whom).  Focus on the adjectives you use to describe the project, and make sure you post to the thesis journal. Remember, you should include: 
  	- What it is 
  	  	- What it does 
  	  	- Who would use it
  	  	- Why the maker made it
  	  	- The tone, experience, etc. 
  	  	- Don't forget to post to the thesis journal! 
- **Research Chart**: Make a (physical, analog) chart with the questions you have answers to so far and bring it to class. You will share it in class, and colleagues will make suggestions. Then post it on the TJ along with any other summary of your research to date. Here are some critical questions to answer (as relevant for your specific idea):
  -  What else is out there like it? 
  - How is yours different? 
  - How does it improve what exists? 
  - What audience is it for? 
  - What is the world/context/ market that your project lives in? 
  - In your initial research, have you found something you didn’t expect? Is it an interesting path to follow? 
  - What do you need to know about the content/story? 
  - What do you need from a tech standpoint? 
  - If it’s too much for the time...what are the discrete parts of it you could accomplish? 
  - Note: the best theses come out of things that you've already been working and thinking about. If you're struggling to come up with an idea, consider if there's a project you've done in the past that has some aspect that you didn't have time to explore. What are the threads that you've been exploring so far?  
- **Bibliography**: Start a bibliography/reference resource of all the references that you're consulting. Don't put this on the chart, but keep a digital collection using some tool that can help you keep track of everything (CSV, Google Docs, static web site, Are.na, Zotero, Evernote, Tumblr, Git whatever works for you.) You can post this to the thesis journal if you like.
