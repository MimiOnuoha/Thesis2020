## Midterm Guidelines

Midterm presentations take place **March 10th** in week 7. They are an opportunity for you to share your thesis idea and the progress that you have made on it with an external audience. This audience is composed primarily of ITP alums and folks who are familiar with the program, so they will understand that you're still midway through the process. 

You will have a hard 15 minutes in total for your presentation. The ideal presentation is between 5-7 minutes. If you go longer you won't get as much feedback.

Your reviewers will respond with feedback on the thesis idea, the clarity of your presentation and its doability. There will be 3 of them per session, and two sessions that run from 6:30pm to 9pm on Tuesday the 10th (with a break in the middle).

You will likely want to come with slides prepared. Try to listen, try not to be defensive. You don't have to respond extensively to their comments as that might mean that another reviewer might not have time to give you their critique.  There will be someone who takes notes for you so you can listen to the feedback instead of trying to remember it as you are responding. 

Here is what you should prepare:

- Your thesis statement, aka what is your thesis? Good to be able to sum this up in a brief statement(s), and then you can expand on it. 
- Why have you chosen this topic? Why is it important to you?
- How much have you done so far?
- What will you have completed by the end of the semester?

We will have midterm presentation prep in groups in class next week, so you will get a chance to do some preparation with your classmates.
