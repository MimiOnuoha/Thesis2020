# STANDARDS & REQUIREMENTS

# Overview

The goal of an ITP education is for you leave here with the tools to do whatever you want to do. Those tools include: 

- knowing how to find out what you don’t know
- to be ready for change, anticipate it
-  a willingness to experiment, fail, try again, etc
-  how to take an idea and make it real
- how  to find your strengths and deepen them
-  to follow your passions and trust your gut; to know how to determine the conversation happening within a field and 

The faculty needs to see evidence of mastery of these skills and evidence of what you’ve learned at ITP. Your thesis will be a manifestation of those qualities. For you, the thesis should be something you really want to explore, want to make, want to see in the world. You’re going to spend 14 weeks on this singular project, do something that challenges, fascinates, plagues or delights you. Take the time to enjoy this process.

An ITP thesis is a demonstration of mastery of a particular project or problem of your design. It can take different forms—a physical prototype, a research paper—but the key is that there is a central concept, with a clear statement of purpose: in other words: 1) what it is, and 2) so what?

##Two kinds of thesis: production and written

- **Production Thesis:** demonstrates creative strategies or purposeful innovations in new media, along with the ability to document this work and its implications in written form.

- **Written Thesis:** proposes and defends a position based either on a practical research project and its conclusions (including documentation of your prototypes and trial and error process), or on scholarly/artistic research into the nature and impact of digital media or emerging technologies.

##What constitutes Proof-of-Concept?

In the past, students have asked for some guidelines to know more precisely what is expected of them and what the elements of a good thesis are. This is ITP, and there’s a lot of latitude. We don’t want to lay down rules to stifle your creativity, but perhaps looking at general parameters of acceptability will help you right-size your idea. There will always be leeway and exceptions, but make sure your Thesis Advisor is on board so you’re not caught up short. We want to be satisfied with your thesis, and we want you to be proud of it.

###General Requirements:

- Evidence of research (knowing the field, alternative, previous and current approaches, your audience, how is your project different from other similar things, what are your influences).
- Citation of  your research sources. Wikipedia is kind of a starter resource, a pointer to more primary sources, which you need to seek out and cite. Develop a list of books/articles to read, inspirational projects, experimental work, installations to see, etc.
  - Related: Plagiarism is not allowed! Be sure to cite the sources of your research. That includes code. For example, if you have dropped in some code from Tom Igoe’s book or class, cite that too. Using work without attribution is not just stealing, it’s leaving the impression that you did all the work.
- Process documentation on your Thesis Journal throughout, i.e. at least on a weekly basis.
- Documentation of user testing and feedback when the idea is far enough along to solicit meaningful feedback. By week 10, some evidence of user testing.
- User Experience: While for most interactive projects including complex websites, 14 weeks is not enough time for a fully-functioning product, you must be able to show a demonstration prototype; and also include user experience specifications such as flows and visual design.
- Any material help you get on the development of your project outside of class and Thesis Advisor feedback (i.e. design, programming, production) must be approved by your Thesis Advisor in advance, roles articulated, and acknowledgement given. If you need support for an element or two, that’s ok…*but at least 80% of the work must be your own.*

### Specific Requirements:

*Websites*: A fully functional demonstration prototype. See User Experience above. The content will be fleshed out and real as far as possible (that is, at least half way between lore ipsum and ready to launch!). User tested by week 10.

*Social Media*: The web aspect is the same as websites—but user feedback and testing even more important. The concept will be user tested early (week4) and revised continually.

*PComp*: A working prototype, with a credible theory/plan of how it will work in the real world. User tested by week 10.

*Performances, public art installations*: Must be performed or shown outside ITP. By Week 8, you will have organized and secured a venue to perform, sent invitations, etc. Secure an outside critic in that field by mid-terms. Performance or installation by week 11. Documentation of the Performance for Thesis Week Presentation.

*Digital/Media artwork*:  Finished work that can be experienced by audiences. Knowledge of context (Does your work have any kinship with current art works out in the world?),  historical precedents, how this could be part of a larger body of work in the future, or relates to prior works); working sketches to document progress (process and end-result). Should be able to show documentation of people visiting or interacting with the work if appropriate. 

*Mobile or iPad apps*: mock-up, interactive demo, user tested by week 10.

*Interactive Storytelling & Games*: Scripts and storyboards finalized between weeks 3-5; production to happen between weeks 5-10; user testing weeks 11-13.

*Video*: Remember this is ITP, not the film school. How does your project demonstrate interactivity in a way that a ‘regular’ video would not? Scripts and storyboards finalized between weeks 3-5; production to happen between weeks 5-10; user tested by week 10.

*Research*: Find a Subject Matter Expert (SME) to advise and critique, to assess and verify that the work is valid. By the proposal, you need to have a SME to verify that your idea is doable and/or hasn’t been done. Take the knowledge from an outside field and bring it into the ITP environment/with ITP tools, skills and design. Written paper will be reviewed by 3 people, suggestions of where you want to publish it, bibliography and footnotes.

*Data Viz*: What is your story, why are you trying to visualize, what is your POV by week 3, by Week 4 you have to know your sources and that the data is available.
